\begin{abstract}
  The ZX Spectrum was one of the most popular home computers in the United Kingdom and in Europe in the 80â€™s, as a consequence, many people now remember the days they played in a Spectrum while they were young. The ZX Spectrum is no longer produced, to break the nostalgia for this machine, many emulators appeared and among them is the JZX, a ZX Spectrum PC emulator written in Java. In this paper we present a study of the CPU and memory emulation, and we present several optimizations to it.\\
  \\
  \textbf{Keywords:} JZX, emulator, ZX Spectrum, virtualization.\\
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
In this paper we propose to present a study of the ZX Spectrum home computer covering its system and memory architecture and study how this aspects of the original machine were emulated in the JZX emulator. Finally we propose to study the CPU emulation and apply several techniques to it, learned during the VEE course, in order to improve its performance.

%\section{The ZX Spectrum}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item\textbf{Name:} JZX\\
%\item\textbf{URL:} \url{http://www.sonic.net/~surdules/projects/jzx/}\\
%\item\textbf{VM Type:} System-VM\\
%\item\textbf{Common Usage:} A common ZX Spectrum emulator that can be used in any platform that runs Java. This Virtual Machine is capable of emulating the machine's interpreter and run the existent programs in its time.\\
%\item\textbf{Motivation:} This project will allow us to acquire a deeper knowledge of how a System-VM works inside. This project was last updated in 2006 and has a basic emulation process that we pretend to improve and provide a tool to analyze which operations are more used.\\
%\end{itemize}

%\section{Internal Mechanisms Study}
%  The main focus of our work in this System-VM is to study the mechanism of code emulation so we can improve it, and study the memory emulation mechanism.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\input{optimization}
%\section{Project Approaches}
%In the first place we will need to analyze the actual implementation of the emulator and understand its mechanisms of emulation. In particular we will study the memory mapping mechanisms used in the actual implementation. This first part has as objective discover ways in which we can optimize the actual implementation of the emulator.
%
%After that we will apply techniques learned in the course in a way that improve the emulator. The main focus will be in optimizing the code decoding of the actual solution. To do that, we pretend to implement basic predecoding. 
%The actual emulation procedure uses a switch statement, it is inefficient because the same instruction is analyzed every time it is executed. Our main focus is to analyze an instruction once and save it for later uses, simplifying interpretation and speeding it up. This procedure will raise memory consumption, but still acceptable according to the memory available in computers nowadays.
%While studying the code we will also study the documentation provided by the main developer of the emulator to helps us find places where we can improve it.
%
\input{evaluation}
%\section{Evaluation}
%Along the way of the project we will apply benchmark techniques so that we can the best solutions. We will test the number of bytecodes executed and the number of frames per second before and after implement our solution. The tests will be performed using 128KB games.
%
%\section{Detail Section}
%This emulator is written in Java, so the project will be executed using this language.
%The changes proposed here, will use the algorithms and techniques presented in the lectures and in the course's bibliography.

\input{conclusion}
%\section{Conclusion}
%At the checkpoint, we expect to have a good overview of how the emulator is implemented and have a strategy ready to implement. After concluding this project we hope to have a better understanding of the virtualization mechanisms used in the emulator. We hope to improve the performance and give an important contribute to this project.
