\section{Conclusion}
In the end, after many hours trying to understand the emulator, after improvements and setbacks, we achieved our main goals, apply what we have learned in the VEE course to a real emulator and decrease the execution time of each instruction. In return we increased the CPU use by the emulator, but we believe that with more time we could revert this increase. We believe too that the cache implemented only in the 48K version of the emulator would perform some earnings, instead of the version we implemented applied to both versions of the emulator.
The overall is we managed to apply or we tried to apply real improvements to a real emulator, still, not all of them remained in the final version.
