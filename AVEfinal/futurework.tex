\section{Future Work}
Our work made some progresses to this emulator but we left some work to be done yet. Get a solution to remove the active waits in the emulator, thread operations like wait or sleep lower the performance of the emulator, but with a working multithread solution the emulation time is 100\% update time. Change the necessary variables to short or implement a short array in order to save memory. For the pre-decoding id could be tried to store the memory position plus its page or limit it to the 48K version of the emulator.
