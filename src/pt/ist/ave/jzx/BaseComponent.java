/**
 * Base class extended by all components that comprise the emulator.
 * <P>
 * This class is part of a Composite pattern, whereby it contains a BaseSpectrum
 * instance which, in turn, it exposes all the other relevant components that
 * make up the Spectrum. Any component can get access to any other component by
 * using the BaseSpectrum instance.
 * <P>
 * The class mandates four major lifetime events for any component:
 * <UL>
 * <LI><TT>init()</TT>: Called when the component is initialized. This method
 * should only be called once at the beginning, or after <TT>terminate()</TT> is
 * called. After this method is called, it does <I>not</I> immediately follow
 * that the component's state is reset. You need to <I>explicitly</I> call
 * <TT>reset()</TT> below in order to start with a clean slate.</LI>
 * <LI><TT>terminate()</TT>: Called when the component is terminated. This
 * method should only be called after <TT>init()</TT> has been called.</LI>
 * <LI><TT>reset()</TT>: Called to cleanup the component's state. This method
 * can only be called after <TT>init()</TT> and before <TT>terminate()</TT>.
 * This method can be called as many times as you wish.</LI>
 * <LI><TT>load()</TT>: Called to load up state that was previously saved. This
 * method can only be called after <TT>init()</TT> and before
 * <TT>terminate()</TT> A call to <TT>reset()</TT> undoes the work done by this
 * method. This method can be called as many times as you wish.</LI>
 * </UL>
